## 1. Introduction
This room introduces us to cryptography. It explains the difference between plaintext and cyphertext, what's the purpose of a key and some mathematical concepts used to cipher.

## 2. Key Concepts
- **Cryptography** : The practice and study of techniques for secure communication and data protection where we expect the presence of adversaries and third parties.
- **Key** : a string of bits the cipher uses to encrypt or decrypt data. 
- **Symetric encryption** : Use of a single key to encrypt and decrypt the data.
- **Asymetric encryption** : Use of a pair of key - a public one to encrypt and a private one to decrypt.

## 3. Conclusion
This room taught me how important cryptography is in this modern world. I'm very disapointed that only the first room of each module is free. I want to learn more about this topic. :/

**I'll need to find something else to learn!**
